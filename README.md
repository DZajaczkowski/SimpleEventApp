# SimpleEventApp

## Why it was created?

* A friend asked me to create a base version of event operating app with databases.
* I used the chance to practice Spring Boot when I was still learning some basics of it, including JSON.

## Is the project finished?

* It is not finished per se, but it is currently on hold as there was no reason to continue its development at that point.

## What does it do?

* It is able to do basic CRUD operations on Event, User and Voucher objects.
